## Chapter 1: Clean Code

### Key Points:
1. **Definition of Clean Code**:
   - Clean code is **simple**, **focused**, **readable**, and **efficient**.
   - It is easy to understand, even by someone unfamiliar with the code.
   - It minimizes dependencies and avoids complexity.

2. **Characteristics of Clean Code**:
   - **Readable**: Anyone reading the code can understand its purpose and how it works. It is self-explanatory.
   - **Simple**: It solves the problem in the least complicated way possible.
   - **Well-structured**: Code should have a clear structure with appropriate separation of concerns.
   - **Minimal**: There should be no superfluous lines or unnecessary complexity.

3. **Understanding from Experts**:
   - **Bjarne Stroustrup**: Code should be both correct and elegant. Efficiency should never sacrifice clarity.
   - **Grady Booch**: Clean code is written for **humans** first and **machines** second. Readability is key.

4. **Bad Code vs. Clean Code**:
   - Bad code works, but it is **fragile**, hard to understand, and maintain.
   - Clean code evolves and improves. As programmers, we must avoid leaving bad code behind.
   - **Continuous refactoring** is crucial to maintaining clean code.

### Example (expanded):
```java
// Bad code - poor naming, unclear logic
public int c(int[] a) {
    int r = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
        r += a[i];
    }
    return r;
}

// Clean code - meaningful names, simple and direct logic
public int sumArray(int[] numbers) {
    int total = 0;
    for (int number : numbers) {
        total += number;
    }
    return total;
}
```



## Chapter 2: Meaningful Names

### Introduction:
In software, names are everywhere—variables, functions, classes, etc. Thus, naming well is critical to clean code. Naming should be done with **intention** and **clarity** to ensure code is easy to understand.

### 1. Intention-Revealing Names
Names should express the purpose or intent of a variable, method, or class clearly. A well-named entity reduces the need for comments, making the code self-explanatory. When someone reads the code, they should easily understand what it represents or what action it performs.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example
int d; // unclear what 'd' represents

// Good Example
int elapsedTimeInDays; // Clear and intention-revealing
```

### 2. Avoid Disinformation
Names should not mislead the reader. It’s important to avoid naming variables or functions in a way that might imply incorrect or confusing information. For example, don't name a collection `accountList` if it is not a list but another data structure like a `Set`.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example
List<Account> accountList = new LinkedList<>(); // It's a LinkedList, not necessarily a List

// Good Example
List<Account> accounts = new LinkedList<>();
```

### 3. Make Meaningful Distinctions
Names should be distinct and meaningful. Avoid unnecessary words like `Info` or `Data` in names when they don’t provide clarity. The distinction should reflect real differences rather than arbitrary distinctions added to avoid name conflicts.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example
getActiveAccountInfo();

// Good Example
getActiveAccount();
```

### 4. Use Pronounceable Names
Choose names that are easy to pronounce. When names are easy to say, it becomes easier to talk about them in discussions or when reviewing code with a team.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example
Date genymdhms; // What does 'genymdhms' stand for?

// Good Example
Date generationTimestamp;
```

### 5. Use Searchable Names
It’s important to use names that are easy to search through the codebase. Single-letter variable names or short, vague names are hard to find, especially in large projects. Searchable names increase efficiency when navigating code.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example
int e = 5; // 'e' is not easily searchable

// Good Example
int maxEmployees = 5; // Clearly searchable and descriptive
```

### 6. Avoid Encodings
Don’t encode type or scope information into names, such as using prefixes like `i` for integers (Hungarian notation). Modern languages and IDEs handle this information, making it unnecessary and potentially confusing.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example
int iNumUsers; // 'i' prefix adds no value

// Good Example
int userCount;
```

### 7. Avoid Mental Mapping
Variables should not require the reader to mentally map them to something else. For example, using single-letter variables like `a`, `b`, or `c` forces readers to translate them mentally into something more meaningful. Variables should be self-explanatory.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example
int c = 0; // What does 'c' represent?

// Good Example
int totalSum = 0;
```

### 8. Class Names
Class names should be nouns or noun phrases that describe what the class represents. They should not be verbs. Avoid generic names like "Manager" or "Processor" that don't clarify what the class does.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example
public class AccountManager { }

// Good Example
public class AccountService { }
```

### 9. Method Names
Method names should be verbs or verb phrases that describe the action the method performs. This makes the purpose of the method clear.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example
public void data() { }

// Good Example
public void retrieveData() { }
```

### 10. Pick One Word per Concept
Be consistent in your terminology across the entire codebase. For example, don’t use `fetch`, `retrieve`, and `get` interchangeably for the same concept. Consistency reduces cognitive load on the reader, making the code easier to understand.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example
fetchData(), retrieveData(), getData();

// Good Example
getData() in all cases.
```

### 11. Don’t Pun
Avoid using the same word for two different concepts. The same word for unrelated actions can lead to confusion. Be careful not to overload names with multiple meanings.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example
list.add(item);   // Adds an item to a collection
invoice.add(item); // Adds an item to an invoice

// Good Example
list.addItem(item);  
invoice.appendItem(item);
```


## Chapter 3: Functions
### Introduction
Functions are the building blocks of any software system. Writing clean, small, and focused functions is essential to ensuring code is maintainable, easy to understand, and flexible. This chapter emphasizes keeping functions small, doing one thing well, and avoiding side effects.

### 1. Small Functions
Functions should be small, and ideally, even smaller than most developers think. A function should be able to fit in your view without scrolling, generally no longer than 20 lines of code.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Long function
public void processOrder(Order order) {
    // code for processing order
    // code for logging the order
    // code for sending email
}

// Good Example - Small, focused functions
public void processOrder(Order order) {
    logOrder(order);
    sendOrderEmail(order);
}

private void logOrder(Order order) { /* code */ }
private void sendOrderEmail(Order order) { /* code */ }
```

### 2. Do One Thing
Each function should do **one thing** and do it well. A function that tries to do multiple things introduces complexity and makes the code harder to maintain.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Doing multiple things
public void handleUserRequest(User user) {
    authenticateUser(user);
    fetchData(user);
    logAccess(user);
}

// Good Example - One thing per function
public void handleUserRequest(User user) {
    authenticateUser(user);
}

private void fetchData(User user) { /* code */ }
private void logAccess(User user) { /* code */ }
```

### 3. Blocks and Indentation
Avoid deep nesting of logic within functions. Ideally, blocks of code (like `if` or `for` statements) should contain **one line**, usually a function call. This keeps the code simple and the function shallow in terms of logic depth.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Nested blocks and indentation
public void processOrders(List<Order> orders) {
    for (Order order : orders) {
        if (order.isValid()) {
            if (order.hasStock()) {
                process(order);
            }
        }
    }
}

// Clean Example - Simplifying blocks
public void processOrders(List<Order> orders) {
    for (Order order : orders) {
        processValidOrder(order);
    }
}

private void processValidOrder(Order order) {
    if (order.isValid() && order hasStock()) {
        process(order);
    }
}
```

### 4. Use Descriptive Names
Function names should clearly describe **what the function does**. Descriptive names make the code easier to understand and maintain. Don’t be afraid to use long names if they better describe what the function is doing.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Non-descriptive function name
public void d(Order order) {
    // code
}

// Clean Example - Descriptive function name
public void sendOrderConfirmationEmail(Order order) {
    // code to send email confirmation
}
```

### 5. One Level of Abstraction per Function
Functions should operate at a single level of abstraction. Mixing different abstraction levels within a function makes it harder to understand and maintain. High-level functions should not contain low-level details.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Mixing abstraction levels
public void saveUser(User user) {
    if (user.getName() != null) {
        db.save(user); // low-level operation
    }
}

// Good Example - Consistent abstraction levels
public void saveUser(User user) {
    validateUser(user);
    saveToDatabase(user);
}

private void saveToDatabase(User user) { /* low-level operation */ }
```

### 6. Function Arguments
The ideal number of arguments for a function is zero. If you must use arguments, keep them to one or two, and avoid using more than three. Too many arguments make functions hard to understand and test. Consider using objects if you have more than three parameters.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Too many arguments
public void createUser(String name, String email, String address, int age) { /* code */ }

// Good Example - Using an object to group arguments
public void createUser(UserDetails userDetails) { /* code */ }
```

### 7. Avoid Side Effects
Functions should not modify global variables or other hidden states outside their scope. Side effects make it harder to understand what a function does and lead to bugs that are difficult to trace.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Side effect by modifying external state
public void updateBalance(Account account, int amount) {
    globalBalance += amount;  // side effect
}

// Good Example - No side effect
public void updateBalance(Account account, int amount) {
    account.setBalance(account.getBalance() + amount);  // modifies only local state
}
```

### 8. Command Query Separation - Functions Should Either Do or Ask, Not Both
Functions should either do something (a **command**) or answer something (a **query**), but not both. A function that changes the state of the system while also returning a value can lead to confusion.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Command and query combined
public boolean setBalance(Account account, int amount) {
    account.setBalance(amount);
    return true;  // changing state and returning a value
}

// Good Example - Separation of command and query
public void setBalance(Account account, int amount) {
    account.setBalance(amount);  // command only
}

public boolean hasSufficientBalance(Account account) {
    return account.getBalance() > 0;  // query only
}
```

### 9. Prefer Exceptions to Returning Error Codes
Returning error codes forces the caller to handle errors immediately, cluttering the main logic of the program. Using exceptions separates error-handling logic from normal flow, making the code cleaner and easier to follow.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Using error codes
public int deleteFile(File file) {
    if (!file.exists()) {
        return -1;  // error code
    }
    // delete file
    return 0;  // success
}

// Good Example - Using exceptions
public void deleteFile(File file) throws FileNotFoundException {
    if (!file.exists()) {
        throw new FileNotFoundException();
    }
    // delete file
}
```

### 10. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Avoid duplicating code across functions. Duplicate code not only increases the size of the codebase but also makes it harder to maintain and introduces inconsistencies. Instead, refactor common logic into reusable functions.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Repeated code
public void printUserDetails(User user) {
    System.out.println(user.getName());
    System.out.println(user.getEmail());
}

public void printAdminDetails(Admin admin) {
    System.out.println(admin.getName());
    System.out.println(admin.getEmail());
}

// Good Example - Reusable function
public void printPersonDetails(Person person) {
    System.out.println(person.getName());
    System.out.println(person.getEmail());
}
```


## Chapter 4: Comments

### Introduction
Comments are often seen as a way to clarify code, but they should be used sparingly and only when necessary. Ideally, code should be self-explanatory, reducing the need for comments. Comments can become outdated or misleading, and in many cases, they are a sign that the code itself could be improved for clarity.

### 1. Comments Do Not Make Up for Bad Code
Comments should not be used as a crutch for bad or unclear code. Instead of using a comment to explain confusing logic, the code should be refactored to make it more understandable. Good code is often self-explanatory and does not require comments to describe what it does.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Comment explaining unclear code
int age; // This stores the user's age

// Good Example - Clear code without the need for a comment
int userAge;
```

### 2. Explain Yourself in Code
Whenever possible, the code itself should explain its purpose. Well-named variables, methods, and classes eliminate the need for comments. If you find yourself writing a comment to explain what your code is doing, consider refactoring the code to make it clearer instead.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Comment used to explain code
if ((employee.flags & HOURLY_FLAG) && (employee.age > 65)) {
    // check if the employee is eligible for full benefits
}

// Good Example - Clearer code, no comment needed
if (employee.isEligibleForFullBenefits()) {
    // code to handle benefits
}
```

### 3. Good Comments
While the goal is to avoid comments, there are cases where comments can be helpful or necessary. Good comments add useful context, explain why something was done (rather than what is being done), or provide documentation that cannot be easily expressed in the code.

**Examples of Good Comments**:
- **Legal Comments**: Required by law or licensing, such as copyright notices.
- **Explanation of Intent**: Explaining why a particular approach was taken when it’s not immediately obvious.
- **Clarifying Complex Code**: For exceptionally complex or unusual logic, a comment may be helpful to explain the intent.
  
**Example**:
```java
// Good Example - Explaining a non-obvious decision
// We use a custom sorting algorithm here because the default sorting is too slow for our dataset size.
customSort(data);
```

### 4. Bad Comments
Most comments fall into the category of "bad comments"—comments that are redundant, outdated, or provide no real value. These types of comments clutter the code and make maintenance more difficult.

- **Redundant Comments**: Comments that simply restate what the code is already doing.
- **Misleading Comments**: Outdated or incorrect comments that mislead developers.
- **Noise Comments**: Comments that provide no useful information, such as stating the obvious.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Redundant comment
int userAge; // This is the user's age

// Bad Example - Misleading comment
// Calculate the discount (this comment is outdated and incorrect)
applyTax(amount);
```

### 5. Mumbling Comments
Vague or unclear comments—referred to as "mumbling comments"—do not add value and should be avoided. These comments fail to properly explain the logic or intent, leaving future developers confused.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Vague comment
// Handles stuff
processData();
```

### 6. Commented-Out Code
Commented-out code should be removed from the codebase. It creates unnecessary clutter and can lead to confusion about whether it is still needed. Modern version control systems (like Git) make it easy to retrieve old code if needed, so there is no reason to keep it in the source files.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Commented-out code
// int result = calculateResult(value);

// Good Example - Remove unused code
int result = calculateResult(value);
```

### 7. Don’t Use a Comment When You Can Use a Function or Variable
Instead of explaining code with a comment, consider refactoring it into a self-explanatory function or variable. This improves readability and removes the need for a comment entirely.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Comment used to explain complex logic
if (smodule.getDependSubsystems().contains(subSysMod.getSubSystem())) {
    // does the module depend on the subsystem?
}

// Good Example - Refactor into a descriptive method
if (moduleDependsOnSubsystem(smodule, subSysMod)) {
    // code
}

private boolean moduleDependsOnSubsystem(Module smodule, SubSystem subSysMod) {
    return smodule.getDependSubsystems().contains(subSysMod.getSubSystem());
}
```

### 8. Use “TODO” Comments Sparingly
“TODO” comments can be useful for tracking incomplete work, but they should not be overused. It’s easy to forget or ignore them, leading to unaddressed issues. If you use them, make sure they are addressed in a timely manner.

**Example**:
```java
// Good Example - TODO comment to mark future work
// TODO: Refactor this method to handle edge cases.
processData();
```



## Chapter 5: Formatting
### Introduction
The way code is formatted significantly affects its readability and maintainability. Good formatting practices ensure that code is easy to understand and navigate, making it more accessible for other developers and your future self. Consistent formatting allows the code to "flow" naturally and reduces cognitive load when reading it.

### 1. The Purpose of Formatting
Formatting is primarily about communication. Code is written for people to read, so its structure should be optimized for clarity and ease of navigation. Well-formatted code makes it easier to spot errors, understand logic, and collaborate with others.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - No consistent structure or clarity
public class Order{private String id;public void processOrder(Order order){if(order!=null){System.out.println("Processing order");}}}

// Good Example - Proper formatting for readability
public class Order {
    private String id;

    public void processOrder(Order order) {
        if (order != null) {
            System.out.println("Processing order");
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Vertical Formatting
Vertical formatting focuses on the placement of code elements from top to bottom. Proper vertical formatting helps the reader understand the relationships between different parts of the code and ensures a logical flow.

#### The Newspaper Metaphor
Just like a newspaper article, code should be structured so that the most important information (high-level functions) appears at the top, and details (low-level implementation) follow. This allows the reader to grasp the overall purpose before diving into the specifics.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Low-level details appear before high-level logic
private void validateUser(User user) { /* validation logic */ }

public void processOrder(Order order) {
    validateUser(order.getUser());
    // further logic
}

// Good Example - High-level functions appear first
public void processOrder(Order order) {
    validateUser(order.getUser());
    // further logic
}

private void validateUser(User user) { /* validation logic */ }
```

### 3. Vertical Openness Between Concepts
Use blank lines to separate different concepts or blocks of logic. This helps visually distinguish between unrelated sections of code, making it easier to follow.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - No separation between concepts
public class PaymentProcessor {
    public void processPayment(double amount){logPayment(amount);deductBalance(amount);sendConfirmation();}
    private void logPayment(double amount){System.out.println("Logging payment of " + amount);}
    private void deductBalance(double amount){System.out.println("Deducting balance of " + amount);}
    private void sendConfirmation(){System.out.println("Sending confirmation email.");}
}

// Good Example - Blank lines to separate different concerns
public class PaymentProcessor {
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        logPayment(amount);
        deductBalance(amount);
        sendConfirmation();
    }

    private void logPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Logging payment of " + amount);
    }

    private void deductBalance(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Deducting balance of " + amount);
    }

    private void sendConfirmation() {
        System.out.println("Sending confirmation email.");
    }
}
```

### 4. Vertical Density
While vertical openness helps separate different concepts, vertical density refers to keeping related lines of code close together. Lines that are closely related should appear without unnecessary spaces between them.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Unnecessary vertical spacing within a block of related code
public class UserService {
    
    public void createUser(User user) {
        
        validate(user);
        
        saveToDatabase(user);
        
        sendWelcomeEmail(user);
    }
}

// Good Example - Related lines are grouped together
public class UserService {
    public void createUser(User user) {
        validate(user);
        saveToDatabase(user);
        sendWelcomeEmail(user);
    }
}
```

### 5. Vertical Distance
Functions that are closely related should appear near each other in the code. Keeping related functions close together reduces the need to scroll through files and improves the readability of the code.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Closely related methods are placed far apart
public class Cart {
    public void checkout() {
        double total = calculateTotal();
    }

    // unrelated methods here...

    private double calculateTotal() {
        return 100.0;
    }
}

// Good Example - Related methods are kept together
public class Cart {
    public void checkout() {
        double total = calculateTotal();
    }

    private double calculateTotal() {
        return 100.0;
    }
}
```

### 6. Horizontal Formatting
Horizontal formatting deals with the placement of code elements across the width of the page. Long lines of code are hard to read and should be broken up. Additionally, the horizontal spacing between elements should reflect their logical relationship.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Long line and lack of horizontal spacing
public void processPayment(Payment payment){payment.charge();payment.sendReceipt();logTransaction(payment);}

// Good Example - Proper horizontal spacing and line breaking
public void processPayment(Payment payment) {
    payment.charge();
    payment.sendReceipt();
    logTransaction(payment);
}
```

### 7. Indentation
Indentation is used to show the structure and hierarchy of code blocks. Proper indentation ensures that nested logic (such as loops, conditionals, or method calls) is easily distinguishable from other parts of the code.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Incorrect indentation
public class PaymentService{
public void process(){double total = calculateTotal();if(total>0){System.out.println("Processing payment.");}}}

// Good Example - Correct indentation
public class PaymentService {
    public void process() {
        double total = calculateTotal();
        if (total > 0) {
            System.out.println("Processing payment.");
        }
    }
}
```

### 8. Horizontal Alignment
While aligning code vertically (like aligning assignment operators) can sometimes improve readability, it should be used sparingly as it can lead to inconsistent and hard-to-maintain code.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Excessive alignment
int    firstVar      = 10;
double secondVariable = 20.0;
float  thirdVar     = 30.0f;

// Good Example - Avoiding unnecessary alignment
int firstVar = 10;
double secondVariable = 20.0;
float thirdVar = 30.0f;
```

### 9. Breaking Indentation Rules
Avoid breaking indentation rules, such as collapsing multiple statements on a single line. Proper indentation makes the code easier to read and maintain. Combining statements on a single line can lead to confusion.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Multiple statements on one line
if (total > 0) {processPayment();}

// Good Example - Each statement on its own line
if (total > 0) {
    processPayment();
}
```

### 10. Team Rules
Consistency is key when it comes to formatting. Your team should agree on a set of formatting rules and apply them uniformly across the codebase. Adopting automated tools like linters or code formatters can help enforce these rules and ensure consistency.




## Chapter 6: Objects and Data Structures

#### 1. **Data Abstraction**
- **Key Idea**: Objects should hide their data and expose behavior through abstract methods. Classes that expose their internal implementation through getters and setters fail to properly encapsulate behavior and create unnecessary dependencies.
  - Objects should represent data **abstractly** rather than exposing details of their internal structure.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Exposing Implementation
public class Point {
    public double x;
    public double y;
}

// Clean Example - Abstracting Data
public interface Point {
    double getX();
    double getY();
    void setCartesian(double x, double y);
    double getR();
    double getTheta();
    void setPolar(double r, double theta);
}
```
*Explanation*: The bad example exposes the internal coordinates directly. In contrast, the clean example abstracts the data behind methods that hide how the coordinates are stored (either Cartesian or polar).

#### 2. **Data/Object Anti-Symmetry**
- **Key Idea**: Objects and data structures serve opposite purposes. Objects **hide** their data behind behavior, while data structures **expose** their data and have little or no behavior.
  - Objects encapsulate data and provide methods to manipulate that data. Data structures, on the other hand, provide direct access to their fields.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Data Structure with Behavior
public class Square {
    public Point topLeft;
    public double side;

    public double area() {
        return side * side;
    }
}

// Clean Example - Separation of Data and Behavior
public class Geometry {
    public double area(Square s) {
        return s.side * s.side;
    }
}
```
*Explanation*: The bad example mixes data (public fields) and behavior (`area()` method). The clean example separates the two, making it easier to modify and maintain.

#### 3. **The Law of Demeter**
- **Key Idea**: The Law of Demeter suggests that a method should only call methods on objects that are:
  - Directly passed as parameters.
  - Created within the method.
  - Instance variables of the object.
  
- It discourages “**train wrecks**,” where one method accesses deep internal structures of other objects.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Violating the Law of Demeter
final String outputDir = ctxt.getOptions().getScratchDir().getAbsolutePath();

// Clean Example - Following the Law of Demeter
final String outputDir = ctxt.getAbsoluteScratchDirPath();
```
*Explanation*: The bad example involves multiple method calls to navigate through object hierarchies. The clean example simplifies the interaction by moving the responsibility of returning the path to the `ctxt` object itself.

#### 4. **Train Wrecks**
- **Key Idea**: Train wrecks refer to chains of method calls like `a.b().c().d()`. These make the code difficult to understand and violate encapsulation principles.
  
- **Solution**: Avoid long chains of method calls by asking objects to perform specific tasks rather than exposing their internal components.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Train Wreck
final String filePath = system.getConfig().getDirectory().getFile().getAbsolutePath();

// Clean Example
final String filePath = system.getConfigFilePath();
```
*Explanation*: The bad example chains multiple method calls, which makes it fragile and difficult to maintain. The clean example encapsulates the logic in a method that provides the result directly.

#### 5. **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**
- **Key Idea**: DTOs are simple data structures with public fields or accessors, often used to transfer data between systems. They don't contain behavior and are used mainly for **data transport**.
  
- **Example**:
```java
// Data Transfer Object Example
public class Address {
    private String street;
    private String city;
    private String state;
    private String zip;

    public Address(String street, String city, String state, String zip) {
        this.street = street;
        this.city = city;
        this.state = state;
        this.zip = zip;
    }

    public String getStreet() { return street; }
    public String getCity() { return city; }
    public String getState() { return state; }
    public String getZip() { return zip; }
}
```
*Explanation*: The DTO is used to encapsulate data without adding behavior. This pattern is useful for transferring data between layers of an application or between systems.

#### 6. **Active Record**
- **Key Idea**: Active Record is a pattern where data structures (similar to DTOs) have **basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** behavior. Active Records interact directly with the database and contain methods like `save()` and `find()`.

**Example**:
```java
public class User extends ActiveRecord {
    public String name;
    public String email;

    public void save() {
        // code to save user to database
    }

    public static User find(int id) {
        // code to find user by id
    }
}
```
*Explanation*: Active Record combines data structure (public fields) with simple behavior (methods for database interaction). It simplifies database handling but can lead to mixing business logic with persistence logic if overused.



## Chapter 7: Error Handling

#### 1. **Use Exceptions Rather Than Return Codes**
- **Key Idea**: In the past, error handling was often done by returning error codes from functions. However, this approach clutters the code, as the caller must immediately check for errors after every call.
  - **Exceptions** make the code cleaner by separating error-handling logic from normal flow, improving both readability and maintainability.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Using Error Codes
if (deletePage(page) == E_OK) {
    if (registry.deleteReference(page.name) == E_OK) {
        if (configKeys.deleteKey(page.name.makeKey()) == E_OK) {
            logger.log("page deleted");
        } else {
            logger.log("configKey not deleted");
        }
    } else {
        logger.log("deleteReference from registry failed");
    }
} else {
    logger.log("delete failed");
}

// Clean Example - Using Exceptions
try {
    deletePage(page);
    registry.deleteReference(page.name);
    configKeys.deleteKey(page.name.makeKey());
} catch (Exception e) {
    logger.log(e.getMessage());
}
```
*Explanation*: The clean version uses exceptions to separate error handling from the core logic.

#### 2. **Write Your Try-Catch-Finally Statement First**
- **Key Idea**: The `try-catch-finally` block defines a scope within which exceptions can occur. Start by writing this block first when dealing with code that may throw exceptions. This helps ensure that you maintain a consistent state, regardless of what happens in the `try` block.
  - Think of `try` blocks like transactions: either they complete successfully or roll back to a consistent state.

**Example**:
```java
// Good Example - Writing Try-Catch-Finally First
try {
    FileInputStream stream = new FileInputStream("data.txt");
    stream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    throw new StorageException("File not found", e);
}
```
*Explanation*: By defining error-handling logic up front, you create clear, maintainable code that avoids unexpected failures.

#### 3. **Use Unchecked Exceptions**
- **Key Idea**: In general application development, **unchecked exceptions** (i.e., exceptions that do not need to be declared in a method’s `throws` clause) are preferable because they reduce the complexity of error-handling code. 
  - Checked exceptions can cause unnecessary dependencies and break the **Open/Closed Principle** by forcing changes in higher levels of the codebase whenever exceptions are added at lower levels.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Using Checked Exceptions
public void process() throws FileNotFoundException, IOException {
    // method logic
}

// Clean Example - Using Unchecked Exceptions
public void process() {
    try {
        // method logic
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
}
```
*Explanation*: By using unchecked exceptions, we prevent method signatures from becoming cluttered, and we reduce coupling between components.

#### 4. **Provide Context with Exceptions**
- **Key Idea**: Always include meaningful messages and context in exceptions. When an exception occurs, the developer should be able to understand what failed and why by examining the error message and stack trace.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Generic Exception
throw new RuntimeException();

// Clean Example - Providing Context
throw new RuntimeException("Failed to process order: Order ID " + orderId);
```
*Explanation*: The clean version provides useful information (e.g., the `orderId`), making it easier to trace the issue and debug the problem.

#### 5. **Define Exception Classes in Terms of a Caller’s Needs**
- **Key Idea**: Exceptions should be classified based on how they are handled by the caller, not necessarily by their source or type. This helps avoid duplication of error-handling logic and creates cleaner, more maintainable code.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Handling Specific Exception Types
try {
    port.open();
} catch (DeviceResponseException e) {
    reportPortError(e);
} catch (ATM1212UnlockedException e) {
    reportPortError(e);
} catch (GMXError e) {
    reportPortError(e);
}

// Clean Example - Wrapping Exceptions in a Common Type
try {
    port.open();
} catch (PortDeviceFailure e) {
    reportError(e);
}
```
*Explanation*: The clean version wraps all the different exceptions into a single `PortDeviceFailure` exception, simplifying the error-handling code.

#### 6. **Define the Normal Flow**
- **Key Idea**: Error handling should not obscure the normal flow of the program. A special-case object (i.e., a default object used in place of an error condition) can help keep the logic clean.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Using Exceptions for Special Cases
try {
    MealExpenses expenses = expenseReportDAO.getMeals(employee.getID());
    total += expenses.getTotal();
} catch (MealExpensesNotFound e) {
    total += getMealPerDiem();
}

// Clean Example - Using Special Case Object
MealExpenses expenses = expenseReportDAO.getMeals(employee.getID());
total += expenses.getTotal();
```
*Explanation*: The clean example uses a **special-case pattern** to simplify the code by returning a default `MealExpenses` object, rather than using an exception to handle a special case.

#### 7. **Don’t Return Null**
- **Key Idea**: Returning `null` forces the caller to handle the possibility of `null` values, leading to error-prone code filled with `null` checks. Instead, throw exceptions or use a **special case** object.
  
**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Returning Null
public Item findItem(String id) {
    return null;  // Item not found
}

// Clean Example - Using a Special Case Object
public Item findItem(String id) {
    return Item.NOT_FOUND;  // Special case object
}
```
*Explanation*: The clean version avoids returning `null` by using a special-case object (`Item.NOT_FOUND`), making the code safer and more predictable.

#### 8. **Don’t Pass Null**
- **Key Idea**: Similarly, avoid passing `null` as an argument. Always assume that your methods expect valid, non-null arguments. If necessary, throw an exception if a method receives `null`.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Passing Null
calculator.xProjection(null, new Point(12, 13));

// Clean Example - Throwing an Exception for Null Argument
public double xProjection(Point p1, Point p2) {
    if (p1 == null || p2 == null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Points cannot be null");
    }
    return (p2.x - p1.x) * 1.5;
}
```
*Explanation*: The clean example ensures that `null` is never passed to the `xProjection` method by throwing an `IllegalArgumentException` when a `null` value is detected.


## Chapter 8: Boundaries

#### 1. **Using Third-Party Code**
- **Key Idea**: There is an inherent tension between third-party libraries and the code you write. External code is often designed for general use, making it more complex and broad. Your goal is to simplify and adapt that complexity to your specific application.
  - It is important to encapsulate third-party code within your own application to minimize dependencies and control interactions with external systems.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Exposing Third-Party Code
Map<String, Sensor> sensors = new HashMap<>();
Sensor sensor = sensors.get(sensorId);

// Clean Example - Encapsulating Third-Party Code
public class Sensors {
    private Map<String, Sensor> sensors = new HashMap<>();

    public Sensor getById(String id) {
        return sensors.get(id);
    }
}
```
*Explanation*: By creating a wrapper class (`Sensors`), we prevent the rest of the system from directly interacting with the third-party `Map` interface. This ensures easier maintenance and isolation.

#### 2. **Exploring and Learning Boundaries**
- **Key Idea**: When working with third-party systems, you often encounter unknowns, especially at the boundaries between your code and theirs. Instead of experimenting directly within your production code, you can write **learning tests** to explore and better understand the external library's behavior.
  - Learning tests are isolated and provide confidence that the third-party library behaves as expected.

**Example** (Testing a logging framework):
```java
@Test
public void testLogCreate() {
    Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("MyLogger");
    logger.info("hello");
}

@Test
public void testLogAddAppender() {
    Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("MyLogger");
    ConsoleAppender appender = new ConsoleAppender();
    logger.addAppender(appender);
    logger.info("hello");
}
```
*Explanation*: In the learning test, you experiment with the `log4j` library to understand its behavior and limitations. Writing these tests helps you verify that the third-party code works as expected.

#### 3. **Learning Tests Are Better Than Free**
- **Key Idea**: Learning tests have no direct cost, as you would already spend time learning how the external library works. Writing tests provides a structured way of capturing this knowledge, which you can later reuse to verify compatibility with future versions of the third-party code.

**Benefits of Learning Tests**:
  - **Immediate feedback** on whether your understanding of the library is correct.
  - **Early detection** of compatibility issues when upgrading third-party dependencies.

#### 4. **Using Code That Does Not Yet Exist**
- **Key Idea**: Sometimes, the external code or interface you depend on might not yet exist. In such cases, you can define **your own interface** to work against and later adapt the external system to fit your design once it is available. This helps keep your development moving forward without being blocked by external dependencies.

**Example**:
```java
// Defining your own interface while waiting for the third-party API
public interface Transmitter {
    void transmit(Frequency frequency, DataStream dataStream);
}

// Later, create an adapter once the third-party API is available
public class TransmitterAdapter implements Transmitter {
    private final ExternalTransmitterAPI externalTransmitter;

    public TransmitterAdapter(ExternalTransmitterAPI api) {
        this.externalTransmitter = api;
    }

    @Override
    public void transmit(Frequency frequency, DataStream dataStream) {
        // Adapt the call to the external API
        externalTransmitter.sendSignal(frequency, dataStream.toAnalog());
    }
}
```
*Explanation*: By defining your own interface (`Transmitter`), you can decouple your code from the future third-party implementation. Once the external API is available, you can create an adapter to bridge the gap.

#### 5. **Clean Boundaries**
- **Key Idea**: Boundaries in your code must remain clean to accommodate change. Wrapping third-party libraries in your own code reduces the impact when those external libraries change.
  - Encapsulation helps you avoid spreading the use of third-party APIs throughout your codebase, reducing maintenance overhead and isolating changes to a few places.

**Example**:
```java
// Bad Example - Scattered third-party code
public class SystemMonitor {
    public void checkSensors() {
        Map<String, Sensor> sensors = new HashMap<>();
        Sensor sensor = sensors.get("123");
        // Process sensor
    }
}

// Clean Example - Encapsulated boundary
public class Sensors {
    private Map<String, Sensor> sensors = new HashMap<>();

    public Sensor getById(String id) {
        return sensors.get(id);
    }
}

public class SystemMonitor {
    private Sensors sensors;

    public void checkSensors() {
        Sensor sensor = sensors.getById("123");
        // Process sensor
    }
}
```
*Explanation*: By encapsulating the third-party code (`Map`) within the `Sensors` class, you create a clean boundary, ensuring changes to the `Map` interface will have minimal impact on your system.

## Chapter 10: Classes

### Key Points:
- Classes should be **small** and have **one responsibility**.
- Class names should describe their purpose and **responsibility**.

### Example:
```java
// Bad code - too many responsibilities
public class UserManager {
    public void createUser(User user) { ... }
    public void deleteUser(User user) { ... }
    public void sendEmail(User user, String message) { ... }
}

// Clean code - single responsibility
public class UserManager {
    public void createUser(User user) { ... }
    public void deleteUser(User user) { ... }
}

public class EmailSender {
    public void sendEmail(User user, String message) { ... }
}
```
